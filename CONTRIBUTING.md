# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/zencoder-java.git


Make your change. Add tests for your change. 

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Use our [Checkstyle][style] style.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
* Update [the changelog][changelog].


If you have any more questions, [open an issue][issue] or send us an [email][email].
